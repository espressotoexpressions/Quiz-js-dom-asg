- You have an alert for if the user input for numbers is not within desired range, but not for colors.
  - I went about this by having two functions. One for color and one for the box. The defaults for each has a unique alert.
  - However, with a single function for both you can use a more generic message stating something along the lines of "The number OR color you enter is not valid. Try again"
- The site is great. I espicially like the remove function you added for the reset btn. I didn't know a function like existed. I can't wait to have an opportunity to use it myself
